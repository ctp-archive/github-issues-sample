We began capturing confirmed deaths on April 27, 2020 and probable deaths on May 12, 2020. It was unclear whether their main deaths number included probable deaths or excluded them so we had some switching between using the main number as confirmed and subtracting the probables from the main number to get confirmed.  On May 5, 2020, the state clarified to us that their main death number did not include the probables and we settled on using a consistent calculation. However, the confirmed deaths numbers got shifted backward four days in the timeseries for May 3, 2020 to May 10, 2020, leading to a misalignment between confirmed and lumped deaths.

Additionally, Oklahoma did not publish EORs on weekends or federal holidays. On January 18, 2021, they did not publish an EOR due to the holiday, and so on January 19, 2021, we should not have had an updated data source for the EOR metrics, and should have carried over the previous days values. However, on January 19, 2021, they released their EOR anomalously early, and we updated our data for January 19, 2021. The EOR for January 20, 2021 was published unusually early as well, and we caught those numbers in our data for January 20, 2021, instead of our numbers for January 21, 2021. As a result, we were unable to update their EOR metrics for January 21, 2020, as the EOR was not published early enough for us to catch it.

and instead calls its main case number, which includes both PCR and antigen tests, \"lab-confirmed cases.\" \r\n\r\nWe decided to clear Confirmed cases field of the positive individuals tested via PCR number for two reasons:\r\n- it goes against UT's own labeling of its confirmed cases so it is confusing.\r\n- we are not sure this testing count is as comprehensive as a cases number: For example it

We are using the \"COVID-19 Daily Report\" posted on the [official North Dakota Department of Health](https://twitter.com/NDDOH) twitter account to patch the Current/Now hospitalized metric for 12/8 and 12/10 (and took 12/11 data from the same), as well as deaths for 12/8. \r\n\r\nSource: https://twitter.com/NDDOH\r\n<img width=\"618\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-12-11 at 6 44 38 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66583275/101971409-fd690580-3be5-11eb-9205-be970f6e1b75.png\">\r\n<img width=\"620\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-12-11 at 6 44 23 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66583275/101971410-fe9a3280-3be5-11eb-826b-e008a4efb7a3.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/1009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/1009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/1008","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/1008/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/1008/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/1008/events","html_url":"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/1008","id":763207017,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NjMyMDcwMTc=","number":1008,"title":"[TX] Patching missed Now hospitalized update 12/11","user":{"login":"jaclyde","id":66583275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTgzMjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66583275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde","html_url":"https://github.com/jaclyde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaclyde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1921151980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTIxMTUxOTgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/labels/Data%20quality","name":"Data quality","color":"a3270e","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2017157139,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE3MTU3MTM5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/labels/Publish%20Time","name":"Publish Time","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2199367619,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk5MzY3NjE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/labels/Missing%20Data","name":"Missing Data","color":"e56022","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-12-12T02:48:18Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:48:46Z","closed_at":"2020-12-12T02:48:26Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"State: Texas\r\n\r\nIssue: Texas updated Now hospitalized after publish time.

As a response to this, https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/937 cleared the probable case history, and the Nov. 7 daily update picked up the 77 probable cases total for that day.\r\n\r\nBut the Puerto Rico Department of Health's daily report (released Nov. 7 data up to Nov. 6 inside) actually has a footnote documenting the probable cases total for a couple of earlier dates:\r\n\r\n![fn4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4076056/98454262-7670cb00-2117-11eb-9a3b-b783c7c62221.png)\r\n\r\n...which reads at the beginning: \"The total of probable cases from October 10, 2020 to November 4, 2020 was seventy two (72): [detail list of the dates and counts by sample date].\" From this we can backfill the count of probable cases on Nov. 5 and 6 as 72. (Yes, Nov. 5 and 6. See below.)\r\n\r\n**NOTE ON OFF-BY-ONE DATES:** The way the Puerto Rico Department of Health daily reports are dated is that the front page has a \"data update date\" field (\"fecha de actualización de los datos\"), and then they are published on the next date, which makes the dates inside the official report systematically one date earlier than the COVID Tracking Project's scraper-based capture. So while the Project's data currently says 37,490 confirmed cases in Puerto Rico on Nov. 7, the Department of Health gives that as its Nov. 6 total.  **Therefore, the Nov. 4 date on the footnote above should be read as Nov. 5 using the Project's dating convention.** And that implies:\r\n\r\n* 72 cases as of Nov. 4 (PRDoH) ⟹ 72 cases on Nov. 5 (COVID Tracking)\r\n* 5 new, 77 total on Nov. 6 (PRDoH) ⟹ 72 on Nov. 6 and 77 on Nov. 7 (COVID Tracking)\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\n* Puerto Rico Department of Health [daily report released Nov. 7, 2020 (data up to Nov. 6)](http://www.salud.gov.pr/Estadisticas-Registros-y-Publicaciones/Estadsticas%20Casos%20Positivos%20COVID19%20Noviembre%202020/Informe%20Casos%20Positivos%20COVID-19%20(07%20noviembre%202020).pdf)\r\n\r\nScreenshot of front page of this report.

We sourced a few of our total positive values from the respective day's PR. The issue with this is that, while those values were the most up to date values at the time of the PR, they were unaligned with the screenshots and the 1 day lag on the dashboard which throws off the proposed probable values' alignment. The days we used PR values are 4/29, 5/8, 5/10, and 5/11. These values should be changed to 14316, 18371, 19375, 19703, respectively.\r\n\r\n2. Separate from these PRs, we had two values entered incorrectly on 4/25 (12256) and 8/27 (52229). These values should be changed to 12255 and 52228, respectively, to reflect the screen-shotted values from those days and the values from the archived files mentioned above. These revisions are also in blue in the proposed section.\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, we entered the total positive value in the confirmed case column on 6/13. The value should be changed from 28822 to 26215 to reflect the screenshotted value/archived value.\r\n\r\n**Links to data sources**\r\n4/25: https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/CO/CO-20200424-180528.png ; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QcI_QvssZpVxT5ib6yHoeHchLIuIIZkX45eKrn4ciCU/edit#gid=1892357304\r\n\r\n4/29: https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/CO/CO-20200429-000541.png\r\n\r\n5/8: https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/CO/CO-20200507-180530.png\r\n\r\n5/10: https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/CO/CO-20200509-180520.png\r\n\r\n5/11: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e2TLX1eJw9kueTZBssoA9eRWIwEtpgC3HZODao9mGGo/edit#gid=1282281468 ;\r\nhttps://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/CO/CO-20200511-120513.png\r\n\r\n6/13: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bBAC7H-pdEDgPxRuU_eR36ghzc0HWNf1\r\n\r\n8/27: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sU6w75m7SXuRR7gZxMiMhFksez6D9V2pGFjFZaLwRso/edit#gid=1728791480 (confirmed/probable breakdown not available in screenshots due to changed dashboard)\r\n\r\nThis issue solves https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/423","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/847","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/847/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/847/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/847/events","html_url":"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/847","id":704450609,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MDQ0NTA2MDk=","number":847,"title":"[VA] Probables Backfill","user":{"login":"jesseandersonumd","id":57415941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDE1OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57415941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd","html_url":"https://github.com/jesseandersonumd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesseandersonumd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2162087998,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTYyMDg3OTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/labels/Backfill","name":"Backfill","color":"3a9eb2","default":false,"description":"Backfill histoircal data from state provided sources"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-09-18T15:03:00Z","updated_at":"2020-09-24T18:16:50Z","closed_at":"2020-09-24T18:16:50Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**State or US**: VA\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\nCTP started reporting probables generally around 7/28 for many states.

\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\nCOVID19Tracking describes Arizona data as including all tests. This is wrong. **This error in how COVID19Tracking describes these data has resulted in researchers and analysts who use these data incorrectly calculating test positivity by using all positives, but only a portion of negatives.** This issue has not received attention for 15 days. It is an important, but thankfully simple fix. Update the data quality grades.\r\n\r\nCOVID19Tracking Data quality grades for Arizona have a check for \"Machine readable\" and \"Reporting total test conducted\". There are two issues here:\r\n\r\n- Reporting total test conducted\r\nThe Director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, Dr. Cara Christ, is quoted in local media today as saying they do not report total tests. The dashboard reports a figure for \"total tests\", but Dr. Christ explains in her interview that this is not \"total tests\".  Some labs are not reporting negative results to the state, so DHS is unable to include those negative results in the total. They report all positive tests, but only some of the negative tests, making the \"total test\" figure the sum of the all the tests they have, rather than the actual total conducted. Please update the data quality grade accordingly.\r\n\r\n- Machine readable\r\nConfirmed/probable cases and confirmed/probable deaths are reported as a tableau vizintooltip. The data itself is an image of numbers, with no alt text. I'm unable to parse the image with OCR, so I'm not sure how this is machine readable. I could be missing something, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to data source**\r\n- Total tests\r\nSee [azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/news/continuing_coverage/coronavirus_coverage/the-reason-why-there-are-so-many-conflicting-covid-19-positivity-rates-for-arizona/article_83fa2d80-dc33-11ea-8d38-17fac0e3733a.html)\r\n\r\n> Dr. Christ says some labs across the state report all their negative and positive cases while other labs only report their positive cases.\r\n> \r\n> When calculating the positivity, the state does not include positive cases unless the lab also provides negative cases. Johns Hopkins uses all data collected.\r\n> \r\n> Dr. Christ says using the positives without the negatives creates a falsely high number.\r\n> \r\n> \"You could have one person get tested, and it gets reported to the department, but there could have been 1,000 people tested. If those negatives don't get included, you'd have 100% positivity, and that's not accurate,\" says Dr. Christ.\r\n\r\nDr. Christ says more in the video. The relevant section starts at 4:06. Dr. Christ is saying that you (the source of JHU's calculation) do not, in fact, have the denominator for the percent positivity statistic (total tests) because they (DHS) are not reporting it. This should be reflected in the data quality grade.\r\n\r\nFurther reporting on this issue with comments from state public health authorities:\r\nhttps://www.abc15.com/news/state/arizonas-handling-of-covid-19-health-data-gets-new-challenge\r\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/08/17/arizona-leaves-out-written-faxed-test-results-when-calculating-covid-19-percent-positivity/5587283002/\r\nhttps://www.azfamily.com/news/continuing_coverage/coronavirus_coverage/state-of-arizona-johns-hopkins-have-different-covid-19-stats-for-same-data/article_76bde470-de3d-11ea-957d-9f65c34e435c.html\r\n\r\n- Machine readable \r\nRe: confirmed/probable, see [the state dashboard](https://azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php)\r\n\r\nExtracting the vizintooltip from the page source, the breakdown of confirmed/probable (for example) is an image.

There is a one day gap on 5/17 where the testing value was reported under 'Total Tests (PCR).' On 6/12, we began reporting all testing numbers under 'Total Tests (PCR).' This is in line with TN's reporting change. On 6/12, they changed their testing number label to be explicitly PCR. This is what we see today in the PDFs.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have a 5/19 outreach that is as follows:\r\n- - - - - \r\n**Q:** \"Does \"total tested\" refer to people tested or specimens tested? Are antibody tests included in this figure, and if so does the state have plans to break them out?\"\r\n\r\n**A:** \"The total number of negative and positive results posted on Tennessee’s websites includes PCR testing, which tests for current infection. Antibody testing is not included on our dashboards, but CDC is including antibody testing in the numbers they have reported.\r\n\r\n Additionally, we only count a positive case once; subsequent positive tests on one individual do not count toward the total tests posted on Tennessee’s website. CDC’s total testing numbers include all tests performed; therefore, multiple positive tests on one individual will be counted in CDC’s U.S. COVID Testing dashboard. CDC includes multiple positive tests in their count of all tests performed, NOT in their count of cases.\"\r\n- - - - - \r\n*** This outreach question can be found in the Reporting team outreach sheet.\r\n\r\nThere are testing numbers spanning all the way back to our first screenshot for 3/15, but TN only begins reporting complete testing numbers on 3/24. When TN began releasing daily PDFs on 4/11, they also included testing numbers, albeit also ambiguous as to what type of testing the numbers referred to. Given the above outreach and the fact that testing trends seem to have been consistent throughout our time series, I think we can make the inference that we should be able to back fill through 3/24. This would be a backfill team decision, though.\r\n\r\n**Link to data source**\r\nThis data comes from TN's daily Epidemiology and Surveillance Data PDF:

But this is invalid because the former includes **PCR and serology** tests, while the latter includes **only PCR** tests.  The correct value to use for `negativeIncrease` would be \"Number of new tests reported today\" which is higher since it includes serology tests.  Then at least `positiveIncrease` and `negativeIncrease` would be reporting from the same collection of tests (i.e. both PCR and serology).  Coincidentally, the fraction positive by PCR and by serology in Arizona happens to be similar at this time, due to the past and current trajectory of the epidemic.  Hopefully in the future the Arizona website will offer a daily breakdown of PCR+ and PCR- tests, but at this time they only offer the daily total of PCR tests (and of serology tests), and then the weekly breakdown on a different section of the website (see \"Laboratory Testing\" in the link below).\r\n\r\n**Link to data source**\r\nSite:

or US**: Puerto Rico\r\n\r\nI figure this isn't an easy issue to tackle, but I'm growing more and more concerned that the Project's choice to foreground the confirmed + probable cases figures for Puerto Rico, it's not giving the best quality of information available. Perhaps this can be summed up with this chart that I make with [my Puerto Rico COVID-19 data collection and visualization project](https://github.com/sacundim/covid-19-puerto-rico):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"858\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-19 at 3 20 54 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4076056/87886612-7e272b00-c9d3-11ea-896a-ec1a668f5860.png\">\r\n\r\nThis shows, *by date sample taken* (which I'm aware is different from reported date as the Project uses):\r\n\r\n* Blue: New confirmed cases\r\n* Orange: New probable cases\r\n\r\nLines are 7-day averages, dots are the raw values straight from charts in Puerto Rico's Department of Health's official daily PDF reports, samples of which I attach at the bottom of this issue.\r\n\r\nThe very striking pattern I wish to highlight in my chart is the following:\r\n\r\n* New probable cases (orange line) have been found at a more or less flat rate (70-100) since early May.\r\n* New confirmed cases, on the other hand, fell from 51.4/day on April 1st to 4.9/day on May 27, and have been on an exponential rise since then (162.1/day on July 13).\r\n\r\nAnd the key observation I'd like to make is that if one tracks of Puerto Rico's epidemic by the sum of confirmed and probable cases, one doesn't spot the exponential climb until very recently, because the probable cases figures—which have in many ways behaved as background noise—mask it out.\r\n\r\nSome additional facts that are worth remarking:\r\n\r\n* Puerto Rico's Department of Health, in its daily case count bulletins ([here's the most recent](https://github.com/sacundim/covid-19-puerto-rico/blob/master/assets/source_material/pdf/2020-07/Informe%20Casos%20Positivos%20COVID-19%20(19%20julio%202020).pdf)), defines a \"confirmed case\" as one that has a positive RT-PCR test (footnote 1) and a \"probable case\" as one that has a positive serological test (footnote 3).\r\n* There were numerous news reports during May from officials in Puerto Rico that large volumes of persons being indiscriminately given serological tests was producing a large number of \"false positives\" that were later testing negative on PCR. (I put \"false positives\" in scare quotes because the people making the complaints didn't seem to clearly distinguish between people with antibodies who no longer had the virus and false positive proper.) See for example this May 24 news story: [\"52 school cafeteria employees who were positive to COVID-19 in serological tests give negative to molecular tests\"](https://www.noticel.com/gobierno/ahora/20200524/52-empleados-de-comedores-positivos-a-covid19-ahora-dan-negativo-en-prueba-molecular/), and note that these 52 were *all* of the positive cases—not a single one from this incident tested positive on molecular!\r\n\r\n### Data sources\r\n\r\n* [Puerto Rico Department of Health daily COVID-19

Date**: 08/01\r\n\r\n**Overview**: Fill in the timeseries for positiveCasesViral in the API (also known as “Positive Cases (PCR)” on Worksheet2) to enable calculating totals with confirmed+neg instead of pos+neg.\r\n**Contribution to Milestone**: This measure will ensure our technique of calculating totals for each state by cases+negatives does not include probable cases in our total tested counts when we can prevent it.\r\n**Other Benefits**: This milestone will also support changing our website graphs to graph just confirmed cases rather than confirmed+probable by drawing on the backfilled confirmed field.\r\n**Potential Challenges**:\r\nStates may not all provide sources we can backfill from, and if they do the strategies of dating cases used in those historicals may not be by date reported and therefore may not match our time-series. We will need to decide what to do.\r\nBackfilling confirmed cases will have cascading effects requiring updates to states where we were calculating negatives by totals - lumped cases. In these cases, negatives calculation will need to be updated to totals - confirmed cases.\r\nBefore states started separating out confirmed cases, there may be discontinuities in the timeseries (e.g. the totals number may suddenly appear to drop the day we switch from using a state’s lumped numbers to confirmed ones).\r\n**Editorial**: None for this issue.

[May 15](https://covidtracking.com/screenshots/CO/CO-20200515-182911.png), CO reports four different numbers about deaths: \"deaths among cases,\" confirmed/probable breakdowns for \"deaths among cases,\" and \"deaths due to COVID-19.\" Deaths among cases captures information about all deaths in probable or confirmed COVID cases (e.g. determined by testing data for confirmed, syndromic or epidemiological evidence for probable), while \"deaths due to COVID-19\" tracks cases where COVID is listed on the death certificate.\r\n\r\nRight now, we fill out our columns like this:\r\nDeaths (confirmed+probable): \"deaths among cases\"\r\nDeaths (confirmed): \"deaths among cases (confirmed)\"\r\nDeaths (probable): \"deaths among cases (probable\"\r\n\r\nHowever, to maintain consistency with other states (e.g. ND) that provide data about whether COVID was the _cause of death_ , we do not want to track \"deaths among cases\" but \"deaths due to COVID-19,\" which tracks death certificate data. Hence for May 15 onward, we are going to switch to:\r\n\r\nDeaths (confirmed+probable): \"deaths due to COVID 19\"\r\nDeaths (confirmed): no data (since \"deaths due to COVID-19\" is not broken down to confirmed/probable)\r\nDeaths (probable): \"no data (since \"deaths due to COVID-19\" is not broken down to confirmed/probable)\r\n\r\nWe will add back the data for \"deaths among cases (confirmed)\" at a later date when we add a column for deaths w/ positive lab tests but not necessarily COVID as a cause of death on a death certificate.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/565/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/564","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/564/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/564/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/564/events","html_url":"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/564","id":649289640,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDkyODk2NDA=","number":564,"title":"[TN] Backfill current hospitalizations from 5/29 till now","user":{"login":"qpmnguyen","id":25627274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjI3Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25627274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen","html_url":"https://github.com/qpmnguyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qpmnguyen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1921151980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTIxMTUxOTgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/labels/Data%20quality","name":"Data quality","color":"a3270e","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"camille-le","id":31285549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjg1NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31285549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le","html_url":"https://github.com/camille-le","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"camille-le","id":31285549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjg1NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31285549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le","html_url":"https://github.com/camille-le","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camille-le/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-07-01T20:13:21Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T21:54:23Z","closed_at":"2020-07-05T21:54:23Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"TN has been reporting current hospitalizations for a while.

They also have changed positive results to representing the date collected. As a result, the data in the COVID Tracking Project since that date almost always disagrees at least a little bit with the official figures, and in some cases is wildly wrong, for example the numbers reported June 15-16:\r\n\r\nCOVID Tracking Project\r\nJune 13: 9658 tested, 2 positive, 9 deaths\r\nJune 14: 0 tested, 6 positive, 15 deaths\r\n\r\nMN Department of Health\r\n(https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html#testing, https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html#cases)\r\nJune 13: 9802 tested, 153 positive, 9 deaths \r\nJune 14: 5019 tested, 148 positive, 15 deaths\r\n\r\nTo correct this, an update to the data tables is needed, and a new method of adding daily results needs to be used:\r\n 1. Use the Testing and Cases data tables from the Department of Health to overwrite current historical data for testing and cases and test totals, excepting the previous 7 days before the current date. \r\n2.  Each day, update the most recent week's data for cases and tests (total and daily) from the revised data tables on the Minnesota Department of Health site.\r\n3. Get the most recent data from the \"daily update\" at the top of the page after 11am CST and the Testing Data table or working backward from the day-over-day cumulative total.\r\n\r\nI understand this is rather laborious.

Thank you.\n\n \n\nIt appears your data for May 22 for the state of Tennessee has an error in the number of tests.  It is stated at the level of positives (433).  The data set download from the state of Tennessee has it at 7,587.  The correction will also impact your number of tests for May 23, which you have at 12,742 versus the state data set at 5,588.  I think this is impacting the algorithm at rt.live which uses your data for its calculation (and whom I am copying on this email so they also know) for the state of Tennessee.\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n \n\n<img src=\"https://frontapp.com/assets/img/favicons/favicon-32x32.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" alt=\"Front logo\" /> [Front conversations](https://app.frontapp.com/open/top_24d01)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/465","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/465/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/465/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/465/events","html_url":"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/465","id":627017215,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MjcwMTcyMTU=","number":465,"title":"[LA] Negatives reported same as total on 28-May","user":{"login":"space-buzzer","id":62236447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjM2NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62236447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer","html_url":"https://github.com/space-buzzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/space-buzzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1921151980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTIxMTUxOTgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/labels/Data%20quality","name":"Data quality","color":"a3270e","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2036763229,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM2NzYzMjI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"d070d8","default":false,"description":"An issue has had at least 15 days of inactivity"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-05-29T05:52:46Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T15:05:05Z","closed_at":"2020-06-23T15:03:29Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"On 28-May both total and negative were reported as the \"total\" value, which increased the total reported through the API.\r\n\r\nTotal from dashboard = `355,027`\r\nNegative should be  (35,5027 -

Take deathIncrease. It is defined as \"Increase from the day before\". It doesn't say what the source column is, so I suppose it's the column \"death\", which is defined as \"Total cumulative number of people that have died.\" I don't see how that can possibly decrease, so has to give rise to a negative increase (known resurrection events did not take place on the dates considered or on US territory). With hospitalizedIncrease, there is uncertainty on the source column, which could be hospitalizedCurrently, -Cumulative or just hospitalized.  Depending on which one is the one, negative increases are a possibility. For negative, positive and totalTestResults, again I don't see how a test can become undone after it was done (maybe retracted or invalidated?) or a person un-tested. Could you please clarify?

which is currently a component of COVID Tracking Project's \"positive\" for that state:\r\n- includes symptomatic people with epidemiologic risk factors (but were not tested)\r\n- positives may be reclassified as negative (subtracted from positive) if laboratory testing is performed later indicating negative\r\n\r\nI also suggest the test type be qualified, e.g. molecular amplification (vs.

This is not reflected on the washington DOH site, which is where you claim to get your data from. I suspect this is because you (or the DOH site) had a retrieval failure on those days, but that failure should not be reflected in historical data. \n\n2. more generally, your historical data for each day appears to be based on the value of the total case numbers retrieved in the snapshot on that day, from the Washington DOH site. But there are external factors affecting the DOH's incoming flow of case reports, and when they add cases to the site, they assign each case to the day of illness onset. Your data would be much more meaningful if you reported out historical data by date of illness onset, rather than date that the DOH put the case up on their site. I assume this would apply to other states as well. \n\nThe net result is that (in my opinion) your data for washington are currently misleading. If there's any way that I can help to fix this, please let me know. \n\nNote from GG/support desk:\nthis seems like a big ask and not sure if it is even doable.

Looking and comparing the latest, I see that the last number recorded on the Florida tracking page is significantly different from the current number posted on the Florida Department of Health dashboard. The COVID Tracking count is greater than the dashboard count. \n\nIs this count including data that is not shown in the dashboard? Did I miss something?\n\nAny clarification or information would be greatly appreciated.

7 Death Count reported at 20,828 \r\nMay 6 Death Count reported at 19,877  \r\n\r\nThis indicates 951 deaths which exceeds the highest number of deaths reported at 799.  There were no reports in the news in NYC or State that this had occurred.  Could someone verify the counts or is this just NYS reclassifying deaths from an older time period because of the issue with nursing homes and adult care facilities.\r\n\r\nAlso is there a way to add current hospitalization to the excel sheets at the state level.  This is critical tracking data.\r\n\r\nThe more significant data analysis is not the total, rather the change from current day to prior day and the measurement of rate of change.  For example NYS shows an overall rate of 28% for those tested as being positive.  Yet since April 1 the rate of testing positive to new tests was at 15% and dropping each day as more tests are completed.  Currently at 8%. \r\n\r\nThis is critical information for researchers to offer opinions on.  Is the virus weakening or is herd immunity beginning to occur.\r\n\r\nGiven that NYC is considered the epicenter the quality of the data available from the City is lacking.  All historical data must be updated daily in order to develop any meaningful analysis.  The data clearly indicates peak deaths were on April 7, but the historical data (one must update numbers for cases, hospitalization, deaths and total cases each day from the beginning) is changed every day which limits any meaningful predictive analysis.  Testing Positive and Hospitalizations historical data also changes everyday.  A one or two day lag in understandable but updating data that is over 14 days old skews analysis and begs the question of overall data reliability.\r\n\r\nLogistics are not just about PPE and hospital rooms for this pandemic.  Accurate and timely data is essential for the scientists and researchers to understand how this virus spreads and communities are impacted.  Contact tracing will not work if the data is not accurate and timely.  Nor will rate of spread analysis.\r\n\r\nThe IHME projections are estimating higher rates of deaths and cases in NY.  If their underlying data is not being updated and models recalibrated the results will be misleading to government planners and hospital administrators.\r\n\r\nI have saved a new file every 3 days so there are historical files that can be used as a baseline to understand the changes to the NYC data.  \r\n\r\n[coronavirus 5-10-2020.xlsx](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/files/4610417/coronavirus.5-10-2020.xlsx)\r\n \r\n\r\nFinally are the serology test results counted as part of the new tests.\r\n\r\nThank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/404","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/404/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/404/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/404/events","html_url":"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/404","id":615743289,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MTU3NDMyODk=","number":404,"title":"New York Death number from May 6th to May 7th has to be wrong","user":{"login":"ecksteini","id":65162149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTYyMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65162149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini","html_url":"https://github.com/ecksteini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecksteini/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"muamichali","id":1749380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDkzODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1749380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali","html_url":"https://github.com/muamichali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"muamichali","id":1749380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDkzODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1749380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali","html_url":"https://github.com/muamichali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muamichali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-05-11T09:43:35Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T14:50:38Z","closed_at":"2020-05-14T14:50:38Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"New York Death number from May 6th to May 7th has to be wrong.

Secondly the dates are not readable by Excel (have to be parsed even though Excel can read a wide variety of standard date formats).  And as I [mentioned before](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/210), data for hospitalizedCurrently and hospitalizedCumulative were for awhile swapped (now are switched back), so Currently was larger than Cumulative.\r\n\r\nBut this is maybe the biggest glitch.  I don't see why once you have a data file going, you need to change the columns.  Yesterday the file reads into Excel with Column O being \"death\", and today it reads in with that column being \"hash\".\r\n\r\nThat's the [state data](https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/daily.csv) from [the API](https://covidtracking.com/api).\r\n\r\nAnd the [US data](https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/us/daily.csv) file still has \"death\" in Column O, so now the two files are inconsistent with each other.\r\n\r\nIt's both easier and faster computationally to just read Column O rather than to actually search for specific text, and usually that works.  In this case, it's obvious enough that the hash is not even a number no less the number of deaths.  But were it a different column with similar-type numbers, say \"recovered\" then it would be harder to notice right away.\r\n\r\nColumn Q used to be \"total\" -- tests -- so that's at least an integer so would plug into analysis and produce wrong results.\r\n\r\nThe \"total\" column header name also indicates another little glitch, which is that they are not descriptive.  Why have a column titled \"total\"?  Total what?  The \"positive\" and \"negative\" columns are at the beginning of the spreadsheet and it's not clear that they are what would be totaled there.  The total column isn't even entirely necessary.  Presumably anyone who is analyzing this data is able to add two columns, although this does save some computation time.\r\n\r\nThe column-swapping though means that as with the date we have to do this the hard way, make sure that you haven't moved things around.  However, even if you have, you might put the data in the wrong column as with the hospitalized before.\r\n\r\nI have VBA automatically reverse the time series order when I paste it, but in general, it's easier to work with time series data that is in incremental order.  It's possible to overcome any hurdles.  It just sort of wastes time and risks unnecessary glitches.\r\n\r\nSo you are springing a few unnecessary traps for people here, I think.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why \"death\" is all the way over in Column O (now Column Q) anyway.  This is probably the single-most-important statistic.  But once it's there, maybe just leave it there -- and certainly don't push it even farther away from the first column.\r\n\r\nAnyway, good job overall with all of the tracking.

pending results.\"\r\nThis is the proof the hospitals in Puerto Rico diagnose the disease without any tests; by symptoms only. But Puerto Rico suffer not only from coronavirus. Puerto Rico has the same time Dengue, influenza, Cystic fibrosis etc diseases and illnesses with the same symptoms. But influenza for example has medications which can cure patients. But hospitals in Puerto Rico did not provide influenza tests. Doctors leave the patients in hospitals died without any medical help. After patients died coroner provide coronavirus tests but not influenza or Dengue tests. 53 people was not infected by coronavirus. But coroners by autopsy did not find the reason of death of 53 people. \r\n\r\nPuerto Rico even does not deserved grade F. Puerto Rico kill patients in his hospitals. \r\n\r\nToday in Puerto Rico was registered 97 deaths. By report of coroners 64 - 53 = 11 patients had positive coronavirus tests.

all, I run [covid-19-tools](https://github.com/mezcalhead/covid-19-tools) which is more of a python library for working with covid-data in object oriented structures.  It does a good job of processing JHU's data as well.  One of the things we can do quickly is run the state-by-state comparison, just after midnight EST.\r\n\r\nIn the following, the first number is JHU's state death count (summed up from the county level).  The second number is the death count from Covid19Tracking's JSON API.  Third number is the delta.  As you can see there are some very good perfect matches here, but NY is obscenely off (JHU problem).\r\n\r\nI'm willing to look at calibrating the models a little bit. In fact, calibrating the JHU county level data to the Covid19Tracking because if we're interested in the best possible data, we ought to be synthesizing as many sources as

number of deaths due to coronavirus disease seemed low to me over the weekend and so I went back to some historical data and it seems as if there has been a complete restatement of deaths by date in MA.  I doubt this was intentional.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the MA history shows that MA suffered its 1000th death on April 12 yet this report from the local NPR affiliate, and a number of other sources, cites April 15. https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/15/coronavirus-1000-deaths-massachusetts\r\n\r\nOn that date, the COVID Tracking States Daily report shows MA went over 1500 deaths.  This constrasts with the unbelievably (unfortunately) small 22 deaths over the entire weekend.\r\n\r\nThe historical Daily tracking reports used to match much more closely to figures reported in the press.  Finally, here are a few days as they were posted on Friday on GitHub.  The Wednesday number of total deaths from last Friday's data shows 2,182 (see below).  That number currently on GitHub is now 2,597.\r\n\r\nFrom Friday, April 24.\r\ndate | state | positive | positiveIncrease | totalTestResultsIncrease | death | deathIncrease | positiveRate\r\n-- | -- |

The fact that most people are being told that they need to be symptomatic to get tested in the first place makes this result highly questionable. Which leads me to two possible conclusions: either people who attempt to get tested (potentially by simply having their temperature read) but don't meet the classification of being symptomatic are then being included in the total testing and negative results figures being represented; or asymptomatic people with access (either via wealth, occupation, social position, or a combination thereof) are being granted special access to testing.

I think this is a great resource and a tremendous undertaking.\r\n\r\nI believe, however, that there is an issue with historical data. States seem to be updating their older case counts as new information becomes available, but the state history series that you release do not update so regularly. For example, the data at the state daily API for New York on 3/12 reports  309 total tests (216 positive, 92 negative). However, the data from New York state (https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/county-county-breakdown-positive-cases)  show 2836 tests that day. The most recent numners do match, so I believe the problem is updates to the prior test numbers, as more information gets reported to the state.\r\n\r\nIt may not be possible to fix this problem by updating all the historical data, but perhaps you could confirm that this is an issue, and that I should trust the state reports when they are available.

Guidelines for updating current hospitalizations have updated to include both pending and confirmed hospitalization cases (if the state reports it). However, the number from 4/12 seems to indicate that only hospitalization numbers from confirmed cases were reported. On 4/11, the number of hospitalizations was 1252, but, the next day it dropped to 751, which is closer to the number of current hospitalizations for cases only on the dashboard. Unfortunately this is only circumstantial evidence since no screenshots for the hospitalization dashboard were recorded. \r\n\r\n2. The number of current ICU and ventilation were also added together for 4/11 and 4/12. However, ICU numbers already include those on ventilation, which means those numbers should be separate. Specifically, the numbers should be: \r\n**4/11** Curr. ICU: 426 | Curr. Vent: 283\r\n**4/12** Curr. ICU: 440 | Curr. Vent: 294 \r\nThese numbers were inferred from the formula on the spreadsheet. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, is there any way we can add screenshots for this page (https://www.vhha.com/communications/virginia-hospital-covid-19-data-dashboard/)?

are reports that New York City will in the near future start reporting separate numbers for confirmed vs. suspected COVID-19 deaths, and Puerto Rico is already doing something similar as of April 9.\r\n\r\nThe data set collected in this repo might be well served to make a similar distinction as well, in order to, for example, avoid big jumps in day-to-day values that are really an artifact of that sort of reporting change.  For example, your website today reports that Puerto Rico went from 24 to 33 deaths, but in reality it went from 24 to 26 under the old standard (deaths of patients with positive test results), and a new category of suspected deaths was inaugurated with 7 cases from March (and a second batch of 7 has been added since this morning).\r\n\r\nAccording to this April 8 story in Gothamist, New York city intends to start reporting counts both of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths: \r\n\r\n- https://gothamist.com/news/death-count-expected-soar-nyc-says-it-will-begin-reporting-suspected-covid-deaths-addition-confirmed-ones \r\n\r\n> New York City officials will begin to count suspected COVID-19 deaths of people who die at home following a WNYC/Gothamist report revealing a staggering number of such deaths that were not included in the official tally.\r\n>\r\n> In a statement, Stephanie Buhle, a spokeswoman for New York City’s Health Department, said the city would no longer report only those cases that were confirmed by a laboratory test.\r\n>\r\n> “The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and the NYC Health Department are working together to include into their reports deaths that may be linked to COVID but not lab confirmed that occur at home,” she said. \r\n>\r\n> She didn’t say when the city would begin reporting suspected deaths along with the overall count. But the new protocol is likely to add thousands to the toll.\r\n\r\nThe story says NYC officials have given no timeline for this change, but as I mentioned above, Puerto Rico today (April 9) started reporting deaths in two similar categories as well: \r\n\r\n1. Deaths for which there is a positive COVID-19 test result \r\n2. Deaths for which there isn't such a result but the doctor indicated COVID-19 in the death certificate \r\n\r\nAs of right now (April 9, 10pm Puerto Rico time), the project's current best source for

MOTIVATION\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in this problem that requires using a relational database.  The problem is just a little to simple to make it necessary.  \r\n\r\nIf we had county data, we would need it.  If we wanted to publish variants, we would need it.  But we are just managing 10 data points across 56 states and over time so it isn't really required.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be worthwhile to move the primary historical record into a DB.  It would be easier to query, be less error prone, and offer us more flexibility in the future. \r\n\r\nThe primary advantages today are that:\r\n  1. we could simplify the spreadsheet by eliminating its need to manage history.\r\n  2. we could simplify the API by eliminating its need to perform derived calculation.\r\n  3. it would make a set of ad-hoc analysis easier. \r\n\r\nThe cost of moving to a database seem minimal and something we can do incrementally.  The only downside is another component  in the stack.\r\n\r\n# IMPLEMENTATION\r\n\r\nBasically, we put the DB between the spreadsheet and the API endpoints.\r\n\r\n>    Google Spreadsheet -> Database -> API -> Web Site\r\n\r\nWhen the shift leader pushes data, it would run quality checks then insert the records into a database table.  The table would replace the CHECKS tab.  The google sheet would then query the database to populate a shortened version of the CHECKS tab.  There also several other tabs that would be populated from the DB.  This process would be run through a REST API.\r\n\r\n# REST API\r\n\r\nThe working API spec is:\r\n\r\n     POST /publish\r\n           Copy from the spreadsheet into the DB.\r\n     DELETE /publish\r\n           Rollback the published result\r\n     GET /publish\r\n           Get meta-data of the last publish operation\r\n\r\n      GET /tabs/checks\r\n            Get data to populate the CHECKS tab\r\n      GET /tabs/checks\r\n            Get data to populate the CHECKS tab\r\n      GET /tabs/states\r\n            Get data to populate the States tab\r\n      GET /tabs/states-current\r\n            Get data to populate the States Current tab\r\n      GET /tabs/states-daily\r\n            Get data to populate the States Daily tab\r\n

History\r\n\r\nAlexis  Madrigal brought two pain points to my attention:\r\n    1. He gets a lot of questions about why our data is out-of-sync with the state's dashboards.\r\n    2. He feels publishing to history at 5PM (in retrospect) feels like a mistake.\r\n    3. He likes the idea of a midnight update but worries that it would be too hard on data entry.\r\n\r\nA group of us (Elliot/Zach/Julia/me) looked at how we could fix this.\r\n\r\nElliot is close to the data entry process.  He said that 5PM ET is a problem because the west coast often does not report on/at the deadline.  He thinks 8PM ET (5PM PT) is sufficient to insure that we get an update for each state every day in the history table (assuming they make one) . \r\n\r\nThe next step in fixing this is for Alexis to find the right people to hash out the best publish date.  \r\n\r\n## RECOMMENDATION\r\n\r\nOur current recommendation is that we move the publish step to 8PM ET but do not change the process otherwise (keep it in the 2nd push) in the near future.  This would reduce operational pressure and make the numbers a lot more consistent.  There are other variations that I will add as comments for separate consideration.\r\n\r\nWe also recommend adding a field, called Source Date perhaps, to the published data that tells the consumers the 'as-of' date.  It would be on a per-state per-day basis.  It would clear up both the questions Alexis is getting and the questions about inconsistencies between Current and History.\r\n\r\nMy only concern about this change is if we have consumers who are news organizations with evening edition cutoffs.  I will list some alternatives in the comments.\r\n\r\n## IMPLEMENTATION\r\n\r\n1. [Now] Add a column called \"Source Date (ET)\" to the worksheet that tracks the timestamp of the data from the state and display that in the history table.  This is very close to the \"Last Updated (ET)\" conceptually but we may want the flexibility to put a different date into the history from the actual date that we last looked at it.\r\n\r\nThat would enable us to be clear on the website about when each record was from.  It would also enable us to leave the old date if the state fails to make an update in the day.\r\n\r\n2. [Now] Back fill all the history records so that \"Source Date (ET)\" is the time of the 5PM push.  Initially, we should make it be the same time (5PM) but eventually we may update it based on the data in the CHECKS tab that records the actual time of update.\r\n\r\n3. [Now] Tell everyone that consumes is a high profile consumer of our data to that we are planning to switch to an 8 PM ET publish time in the near future and listen for objections.\r\n\r\n4. [Next Week] Move the history out of the spreadsheet into a relational database.  This is discussed as a separate issue but mentioned here because it is what will enable us to take the next steps without breaking the current process.  \r\n\r\n5. [Following week]  Rebuild the history using an 8PM ET publish time using  the Checks tab, the screen shots, and backups of the worksheet.  Apply the other data fixes in the same process.   Publish it on a 'version 2' of the API.\r\n\r\n6. [Go Live] Data Entry switches to an 8PM ET publish time.  The web site changes to use the new version of the API.  If you use the old version, the only change is that from this date forward you have data from 8PM.  If you use the new version, you get all the changes and fixes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/168","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/168/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/168/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/168/events","html_url":"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/168","id":596681922,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTY2ODE5MjI=","number":168,"title":"Counties endpoint mislabeled on Postman","user":{"login":"nbaugh1","id":16710500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzEwNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16710500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1","html_url":"https://github.com/nbaugh1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbaugh1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2036763229,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM2NzYzMjI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"d070d8","default":false,"description":"An issue has had at least 15 days of inactivity"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-04-08T15:51:24Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T02:31:35Z","closed_at":"2020-05-07T14:17:44Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The endpoint which fetches data for selected counties in the US is labeled incorrectly on Postman.

He says:\r\n\r\n> Mississippi has done 16,662 total tests. We have 1,177 cases. Our population is a little less than three million.\r\n\r\nThat positive count agrees with the database, but his test count is three times higher. \r\n\r\nLooking at it, I'm also not sure where the project's test numbers are coming from. The webpage for the MS health dept reports only _their_ tests and has a positive rate of 10% or so. (I don't see any info on private tests on their pages.) It also says they've done 5,257 tests. Together therefore they account for about half of cases, but nearly 90% of tests in the project. That seems off.\r\n\r\nIf their pos rate persists in private testing, it would suggest roughly 5,000 private tests have been done, for a total test count of around 10k. That's a lot lower than the governor's claim of 16k, but maybe private companies are testing a different population. His claim seems closer than the project's 5,900 count.\r\n\r\nIn any case, something's inconsistent here.\r\n\r\nSource: https://twitter.com/tatereeves/status/1245843019745673217","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/130/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/129","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/129/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/129/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/129/events","html_url":"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/129","id":593132195,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTMxMzIxOTU=","number":129,"title":"Hospitalization/Ventilator/ICU Data incomplete thus misleading","user":{"login":"faronium","id":11469553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY5NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11469553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium","html_url":"https://github.com/faronium","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faronium/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-04-03T06:31:26Z","updated_at":"2020-04-11T04:44:51Z","closed_at":"2020-04-11T04:44:51Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Can you please update your website to note that the non-testing related numbers are mostly unavailable from states and thus national totals can be wildly inaccurate?

When referring to numbers of tests, positive results, and deaths, use a language of reverence and respect.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/52/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/52/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/50","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/50/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/50/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/50/events","html_url":"https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/50","id":587751076,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODc3NTEwNzY=","number":50,"title":"MO Numbers Not Updated 3/24","user":{"login":"eschmidt2","id":62655973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjU1OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62655973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2","html_url":"https://github.com/eschmidt2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschmidt2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-03-25T14:47:13Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T05:12:18Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T05:12:17Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The numbers for Missouri were not updated on the States Daily 4PM ET tab in the spreadsheet.

presently I'm only seeing screenshots for dashboard. I explained the difference btw the two in the last comment in #29. since site updates only post at 2p, I would say the 5a screenshot is not needed. Also, on a few occasions, the website doesn't update till after 2p (but 6p and 11p should be sufficiently time-buffered for update latency). \r\n\r\nwhy this matters: I have noticed a day where the daily reported new cases (top page) is greater than the difference btw dashboard from day before and day of. each table respectively does add up correctly. I have reached out to state officials for further clarification to account for either lack or abundance of cases.\r\n\r\nI would like top-level page cached for future usage in case mistakes like this occur again in the future.\r\n\r\nnote: both pages Are updated at the same time. this would be a correction for your footnote for MI.
