        <p>May 7 Death Count reported at 20,828
May 6 Death Count reported at 19,877</p>
<p>This indicates 951 deaths which exceeds the highest number of deaths reported at 799.  There were no reports in the news in NYC or State that this had occurred.  Could someone verify the counts or is this just NYS reclassifying deaths from an older time period because of the issue with nursing homes and adult care facilities.</p>
<p>Also is there a way to add current hospitalization to the excel sheets at the state level.  This is critical tracking data.</p>
<p>The more significant data analysis is not the total, rather the change from current day to prior day and the measurement of rate of change.  For example NYS shows an overall rate of 28% for those tested as being positive.  Yet since April 1 the rate of testing positive to new tests was at 15% and dropping each day as more tests are completed.  Currently at 8%.</p>
<p>This is critical information for researchers to offer opinions on.  Is the virus weakening or is herd immunity beginning to occur.</p>
<p>Given that NYC is considered the epicenter the quality of the data available from the City is lacking.  All historical data must be updated daily in order to develop any meaningful analysis.  The data clearly indicates peak deaths were on April 7, but the historical data (one must update numbers for cases, hospitalization, deaths and total cases each day from the beginning) is changed every day which limits any meaningful predictive analysis.  Testing Positive and Hospitalizations historical data also changes everyday.  A one or two day lag in understandable but updating data that is over 14 days old skews analysis and begs the question of overall data reliability.</p>
<p>Logistics are not just about PPE and hospital rooms for this pandemic.  Accurate and timely data is essential for the scientists and researchers to understand how this virus spreads and communities are impacted.  Contact tracing will not work if the data is not accurate and timely.  Nor will rate of spread analysis.</p>
<p>The IHME projections are estimating higher rates of deaths and cases in NY.  If their underlying data is not being updated and models recalibrated the results will be misleading to government planners and hospital administrators.</p>
<p>I have saved a new file every 3 days so there are historical files that can be used as a baseline to understand the changes to the NYC data.</p>

<p>Finally are the serology test results counted as part of the new tests.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
