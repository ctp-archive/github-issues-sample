      <p>Something seems odd with the recent CA numbers:</p>
<ol>
<li>They got 47,000 pending tests back today and they were effectively all negative. In fact their positive increase was lower than yesterday.</li>
<li>Even ignoring the returned pending cases, they added 30k new test results when the most they’ve been able to do before is 7k (once, over a month ago).</li>
<li>For the third straight day, their totalTestResults were an even multiple of 100.</li>
<li>For the past two days, their totalTestResultsIncrease was likewise a multiple of 100.</li>
<li>Their pending cases have also been -00, but I had figured that was just routine rounding.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel a little conspiracy-addled even writing this, but #1 seems so incredible to me that the others seem worth mentioning as well. This isn’t a direct issue for the project, but perhaps someone has a way to ask them about this.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but how does CA rate a grade of B? They clearly have not been reporting negatives with any reliability. Is it clear where the other 30k test results came from?</p>

            <p>In retrospect, California probably should not have had as high a grade as it did.</p>
<p>We’re working on a system to attach grades to data on a daily basis, so you could go back and see that sort of thing.</p>
<p>As it stands, we do not have that system in place. And for right now, I think California is now a B.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. My jury is still out. :-)</p>
<p>If you will be adding grades like that, I’d suggest practical categories, like “reliable for positive rate” and so on.</p>
