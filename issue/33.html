      <p>It looks like your counts include all positives, but only negatives and pending from the state labs. There have been a lot of tests from independent labs, apparently over 1000, but reporting is a bit thin.  Civil Beat has the best reporting I’ve seen.</p>

            <p>It looks like they occasionally update with actual test counts, but not always.  Some of the historical data is probably off as a result. I’m not sure how the history could be corrected.   Most recent data is off, too.</p>
<p>Another issue: the one death was a mistake. After more testing they found that the death was not due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>Note that they no longer report the death in daily updates, but this site still has the death recorded in the historical data.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yes, we have stopped counting the falsely attributed death from our reporting stream and will need to address if we remove it retroactively. We will see if we can include the data you have provided, but we have found the process of including thin data difficult due to the rigorousness our data is subjected to.</p>

            <p>I did some digging to see if I could find the correct test counts for 3/25 and 3/26, but it looks like they stopped reporting them; only positives were reported on these days.  It also looks like the data for 3/21 through 3/24 is not correct.  Three of these days are shifted forward one day, and the other appears to be missing private lab totals.  Correct totals are as follows, with links to the sources. I think positives are correct but possibly shifted by a day.</p>

            <p>Just jumping in to say that I looked at our historical data and from the
22nd onward, we have the same numbers.</p>
<p>The shifts forward are because we record a daily number at the same time
for all the states (4pm ET): so for us, it didn’t show up in our daily
update until the following “business” day. That make sense?  It’s annoying,
we agree. But it’s how the data structure was originally set up and it
would be very difficult to change now.</p>

            <p>Thanks for clarifying–Sorry, I overlooked the 4pm ET time stamp; makes sense. The above count for 3/21 can still correct 3/22.  Hopefully, they will report negatives and test counts again soon.</p>
