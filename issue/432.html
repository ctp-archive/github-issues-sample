      <p>Quite a few issues here. Some typos in data entry and a running off-by-a-day issue.</p>
<p>Because the screenshots are inconsistent, I reference the current official <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx">CA press release archive</a> instead.</p>
<p>California started reporting total and pending test numbers on March 18th, so I’m including those here too. The CTP March CA numbers have “N/A” values for Pending through 3/23. It’s unclear where some of the earlier Total test numbers come from.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-027.aspx">March 18 state data</a> “As of March 18, 2020, 6 p.m. PDT”

<p>March 28 state data is missing for positives and deaths. The next CA state data report is for the 29th. Unclear where CTP data comes from. Treat as non-reporting day for positives and deaths.
CA notes “***This week’s cumulative testing numbers are lower than last week due to an inadvertent over-reporting error discovered by one of the private labs.”
<a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-037.aspx">March 28 state data</a> “As of March 28 2020, 2 p.m. PDT”

<strong>3/29 should have 5,763 Positives instead of 5,708.</strong> Current number is wrong, not just off-by-one.

<p><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-038.aspx">March 30 state data</a>. CA stopped reporting a time cutoff starting with the March 31 press release w/ March 30 data.
<strong>3/30  should have 6,932 Positives instead of 6,447.</strong>
<strong>3/30  should have 150 Deaths instead of 133.</strong>
<strong>3/30  should have 28,704 Total [Tests] instead of 26,996.</strong>
<strong>3/30  should have 57,400 Pending [Tests] instead of 64,400.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-039.aspx">March 31 state data</a>.
<strong>3/30  should have 8,155 Positives instead of 7,482.</strong>
<strong>3/30  should have 171 Deaths instead of 153.</strong>
<strong>3/30  should have 31,038 Total [Tests] instead of 29,254.</strong>
<strong>3/30  should have 59,100 Pending [Tests] instead of 57,400.</strong></p>
<p>Off-by-a-day errors aside, it makes sense to use official state reported confirmed case and death numbers for a date when those are higher than current CTP reported values. It is unlikely the state is making up higher positive case and death counts.</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>@scarson</strong>,
Thanks again for bringing these discrepancies to our attention. For an explanation of why these numbers may differ from ours, see #431. You are 100% right that some of these discrepancies for 3/18-31 are big (we generally do not worry about off-by-one lags, so the pendings + days where the counts are different are the ones we’d like to correct). We have a team working to determine how and whether to update data from historical sources in event of discrepancies like this. I will flag this as a potential source of data to them.</p>
