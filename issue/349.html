            <p>Hey Arlis,</p>
<p>We have not done so solely because each category of information we capture
adds to the complexity of the data ingestion challenge. It wasn’t so much a
determination that this was not important so much as a choice among
multiple important categories of data, given limited resources.</p>

            <p>It was decided that a person’s vulnerability to the virus based on his age
group is not important information? As of a month ago only 3 kids under 18
had died of COVID, and all three had underlying conditions. That would be
reassuring for the vast majority of parents, and I think that’s pretty
important, but this has been a pretty fast moving thing and the total
number of COVID deaths since just a month ago has ballooned. If those
percentages still hold I know some people who ought to have that
information, but the numbers from a month ago can’t be relied on at this
point and the current numbers are not to be found.</p>
<p>I think that decision ought to be reconsidered.</p>

            <p>No, that’s the opposite of what I said. It is important, but so is the other information we record. We only can record so much; it’s an almost all-volunteer team and more data points increases the complexity. States also bucket age differently, so it would be very difficult to produce good summary statistics.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was also interested if you are going to include information on sex and age distributions. Many state dashboards provide this information, and your group seems poised to help streamline data capture from these many different sites. I am part of the University of Georgia’s COVID-19 Working Group (<a href="http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com">2019-coronavirus-tracker.com</a>, github = <a href="https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/COVID-19-DATA">https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/COVID-19-DATA</a>), and we use your data and would like to collaborate in getting these data accessible and analyzeable in a standardized way. Let me know your thoughts.</p>

            <p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>Why don’t you send me an email to <a href="mailto:alexis<strong>@covidtracking.com</strong>">alexis<strong>@covidtracking.com</strong></a> — and I can put
you in touch with the right people on our team. Right now, I don’t think
we’re ready to add the extra labor to gather age, but we could potentially
collaborate with you, using the system we developed, if you wanted to staff
it. Age has some real complexities in trying to standardize across states
(largely overlapping bucketing problems), but perhaps you can think of a
solution that we have not.</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>
