        <p>The report for Idaho at <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data">https://covidtracking.com/data</a> as of 4/26 states “as of 4/24, Idaho separately reports both probable and confirmed cases”. That’s not correct; Idaho DHW started reporting probable cases separately from confirmed (positive) cases on 4/9, and the number of cases shown on <a href="https://coronavirus.idaho.gov">https://coronavirus.idaho.gov</a> since 4/17 has been the <strong>sum</strong> of probable and confirmed/positive!</p>
<p>At the time I opened this issue the API documents stated “positive” is “Total cumulative positive test results”, so I presume the data you’re collecting as “positive” wasn’t intended to include Idaho’s probable counts.</p>
<p>You can see evidence of this in <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/state/idaho#historical">screencaps</a>. Note the label, and what the label says going back through 4/17, 4/9, earlier.</p>

<p>Idaho DHW’s Tableau dashboard (which <a href="https://coronavirus.idaho.gov">https://coronavirus.idaho.gov</a> started linking to on 4/2) has the detailed data needed to fix this, in tooltips on this cumulative cases chart:</p>

          <p>This is still an issue. For example, Idaho DHW reported 2203 cumulative confirmed/positive, 216 cumulative probable on 5/16, for a sum of 2419 (the sum is published at <a href="http://coronavirus.idaho.gov">coronavirus.idaho.gov</a>, the detail is published on the Tableau dashboard linked to from there, daily just after 5PM Mountain, except recently they’ve stopped updating it on Sunday.)</p>
<p>It appears the project has captured positive=2419 for date=2020517.</p>
<p>Idaho DHW’s not explained how these counts handle probables that become positive, but I will say that since there have been days when the probable cumulative count decreased (5/7 for example), so I think what they are doing is subtracting from probable, and adding to confirmed, on the day it is confirmed and reported. That indicates this project may be overcounting Idaho positives by up to 216/2203=9.8% as of 5/16.</p>

          <p>Hi <strong>@waded</strong>,
Thanks for pointing out this data. It was not a problem for positive count since we bundle confirmed and probable cases for that field. However, it turned out that we had sometimes been inferring our negative test counts with total - (confirmed + probable) negatives, rather than total - confirmed, before we made a note of Idaho’s separation of the fields formally. As a result, many of our negative test values were too low.</p>
<p>I went through our edit history for negatives, and located days we calculated the negative value using confirmed + probable positives according to the figures from hovering over each day on the Tableau chart “<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/idaho.division.of.public.health#!/vizhome/DPHIdahoCOVID-19Dashboard_V2/Story1">Statewide cases</a>”. Then I corrected those days to subtract just the confirmed positives (those that had been verified by tests) from totals rather than confirmed + probables. Note that, depending on the time of day we updated, there was sometimes a 1-day lag I had to account for. There were 12 days between 4/16-4/30 I corrected. I also carried over a negative value on one day to prevent decreases in negatives.</p>

          <p>I’ll check back in a few days when this is flushed through and e.g. 5/22’s numbers can be observed.</p>
<p>The change to negatives makes sense (although I think to infer negatives in this way is quite wrong, because of lag between reporting tests and positives, as well as double counting on patient, I’ve not seen any notable analysis based on the tracking projects negative field.)</p>
<p>I still don’t agree that Idaho’s “probable” count should be bundled into “positives”, which API docs still describe simply as “Total cumulative positive test results” and Idaho’s “probables” are not that. But if that is intentional and you’re doing it consistently across states, then so be it (although I recommend API docs be more specific; I will open a separate issue.)</p>
