Some cells in the Deaths (confirmed) column were relying on a formula from the Checks tab. When the Checks tab was purged, it caused some of the values in Deaths Confirmed column to be impacted.</p>

We have <code>REF</code>s only in KY <code>Total Tests (PCR) </code></p>
<p>All the <code>REF</code>s are part of formulas (or bad formulas).</p>
<p>We have formulas in other places too, some are numeric (e.g., <code>=3684+101</code>) which should be fine and stable, others might not be as stable <code>=sum(C3258:D3258)</code></p>

          <p>This issue was originally opened for <strong>KS</strong> <code>Deaths (confirmed)</code> was a formula leading nowhere.
Now we have a few values in this column, instead of the formula. Did we ever have a confirmation that death count was confirmed deaths and then it got revised?
It happened with cases on May 7th – Case count started including both confirmed and probable cases</p>

          <p>The 9 values for <strong>KS</strong> <code>Deaths (confirmed)</code> column (dates 3-11/May) are there by mistake. They were not deleted when confirmed vs probable death metrics were cleaned up prior to publishing these metrics in the API because it was a formula, and the cells looked empty. Earlier this week, the cells were re-filled with a value, but it should actually remain empty.

          <p>We have many states with this empty-formula turned to numbers between May 3rd to 11th.
All of them now got values in these cells, values that I think weren’t supposed to be there, because they looked empty, so were skipped during the cleanup</p>
<p>Numbers should be there</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Empty formula was replaced with numbers matching <code>Deaths (confirmed)</code>: AK, MA, ME, MN, MP, NC, NM,  C, TN (got filled with part of that period), VI, VT, WA, WI</li>
<li>[x] AL – the number for May-3rd differs from <code>death</code> field. I’ll <a href="https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/AL/AL-20200503-180319.png">follow screenshots for May 3rd</a> and update from 292 to 290</li>
<li>[x] FL <a href="https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/542">https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/542</a> The number for 3-May looks like a mistake. The replacement of the empty-cell formula with the value actually did a small backfill here, because <a href="https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-public-api/blob/6c22a80d9dfafdfa1c9932eacc1c7f6e4867133a/v1/states/fl/daily.csv">when we first published <code>Deaths (confirmed)</code> field</a> it wasn’t there, we only started collecting it on May 12th. I’m updating the value for May 3rd to be the same as <code>Deaths</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers should be there but need to be checked:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] IN</li>
<li>[ ] KY – the numbers there are before we started populating this field, and the number for May 3rd is higher than <code>Deaths (confirmed and probable)</code>. The <a href="https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/KY/KY-20200503-121121.png">screenshot for KYs page</a> shows the same number as in <code>Deaths (confirmed and probables)</code>.
KY is most likely correct, no way to 100% verify</li>
<li>[x] NJ</li>
<li>[x] PR numbers should be there. There are no screenshot for this tab (it’s a small internal tab in a dashboard widget) I compared to easy-dc logs</li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers should not be there</p>
