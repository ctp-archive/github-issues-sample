      <p>Hi, I am using the data from <a href="https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/daily.csv">https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/daily.csv</a></p>
<p>I noticed that the following columns contain negative values
deathIncrease, hospitalizedIncrease, negativeIncrease, positiveIncrease, totalTestResultsIncrease</p>
<p>which may be an error or I may be misunderstanding the definition. Take deathIncrease. It is defined as “Increase from the day before”. It doesn’t say what the source column is, so I suppose it’s the column “death”, which is defined as “Total cumulative number of people that have died.” I don’t see how that can possibly decrease, so has to give rise to a negative increase (known resurrection events did not take place on the dates considered or on US territory). With hospitalizedIncrease, there is uncertainty on the source column, which could be hospitalizedCurrently, -Cumulative or just hospitalized.  Depending on which one is the one, negative increases are a possibility. For negative, positive and totalTestResults, again I don’t see how a test can become undone after it was done (maybe retracted or invalidated?) or a person un-tested. Could you please clarify? The number of rows affected is modest, between 10 and 21 for the listed fields. Thanks</p>
